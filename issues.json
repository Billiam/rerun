Restarting my server when code changes is working just fine, but ideally I'd like to have a workflow where I can change environment vars in `.env` and have the app auto-reload with new configuration.\r\n\r\nI see that this is a deliberate built-in feature of the file globbing implementation. Turning this off could be a switch (e.g. `--no-ignore-dot`) or perhaps an implementation of the exclude option #24 could have leading dots, etc. as the default value, which could then be overridden.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to give a shot at implementing this myself. Just wondering if it's already in progress or if you're opposed to the idea."

(Long story short, the HTTP server I use in production doesn't support automatic-reloading, so I have rerun kicking foreman when there are code changes).\r\n\r\nI use Emacs for development, with flymake mode to do on-the-fly syntax checking. It does this by copying the current buffer into a `[filename]_flymake.py` file and then running `pylint` on that file. This file creation kicks off rerun, so it's constantly bouncing my development HTTP server as I'm editing code.\r\n\r\nI'd like to add my vote for a `--exclude` option that can take a glob pattern.
